# Bike_seoul_python

The result of our Django application for the course of Python for data.

We had to predict the number of rented bikes in Seoul by hour with the dataset 
of meteo conditions and amount of rented bikes in Seoul every hour in 2018.

We visualize our data with some graphs, barplot. Everything is on our Jupyter notebook
and we presented them in our powerpoint with our reflexions and remarks about it.
There is also our score and conclusions about the subject. 


We learned the potential and power of Machine Learning, prediction with scikit learn and
also importance of visualization with Matplotlib, it was a great experience !
